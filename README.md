### Session Description

In this lab, you will learn how to add the new AI features into a WPF app and create an app that uses Semantic Search, OCR and Phi-Silica to query a PDF file and obtain answers based on it

### 🧠 Learning Outcomes

By the end of this lab, you'll have created a sophisticated application featuring:

- 🖥️ **AI-Enhanced WPF Application** - Turbocharge a WPF application with AI features and modern UI
- 🔍 **AI-Powered Search** - Semantic search using Microsoft's experimental AI indexing
- 🤖 **RAG-Powered Queries** - Local Retrieval Augmented Generation queries using Semantic Search and Phi-Silica
- 💬 **Natural Language Queries** - Ask questions about documents in plain English
- 📄 **Advanced PDF Processing** - Text extraction with the OCR API and page rendering
- 🖼️ **Visual Results** - Preview relevant document pages alongside query results
- ⚡ **Real-time Responses** - Streaming AI responses with cancellation support

### 💻 Technologies Used

1. WPF
2. Fluent UI
3. Semantic Search
4. OCR AI API
5. Phi-Silica language  model

### 🌟 Semantic Search

The Semantic Search and Knowledge Retrieval API empowers developers to integrate intelligent search capabilities into their apps. By indexing in-app content and making it searchable through semantic queries, users can retrieve results based not only on exact keywords but also on semantic meaning. You can use this semantic index to enhance your own AI assistants with domain-specific knowledge, creating more personalized, context-specific experiences.

### 🌟 OCR

Text recognition, also known as optical character recognition (OCR), is supported in Windows AI Foundry through a set of artificial intelligence (AI)-backed APIs that can detect and extract text within images and convert it into machine readable character streams.

### 🌟 Phi-Silica

Phi Silica is a local language model that you can integrate into your Windows apps using Windows AI Foundry. Phi Silica is optimized for efficiency and performance on Windows Copilot+ PCs devices while still offering many of the capabilities found in Large Language Models (LLMs).
